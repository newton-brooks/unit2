        <h1>STRAWBERRIES CUH</h1>
        <p>The first garden strawberry was grown in Brittany, France during the late 18th century.[3] Prior to this, wild strawberries
            and cultivated selections from wild strawberry species were the common source of the fruit. The strawberry fruit
            was mentioned in ancient Roman literature in reference to its medicinal use. The French began taking the strawberry
            from the forest to their gardens for harvest in the 14th century. Charles V, France's king from 1364 to 1380,
            had 1,200 strawberry plants in his royal garden. In the early 15th century western European monks were using
            the wild strawberry in their illuminated manuscripts. The strawberry is found in Italian, Flemish, and German
            art, and in English miniatures.[citation needed] The entire strawberry plant was used to treat depressive illnesses.
            By the 16th century, references of cultivation of the strawberry became more common. People began using it for
            its supposed medicinal properties and botanists began naming the different species. In England the demand for
            regular strawberry farming had increased by the mid-16th century. The combination of strawberries and cream was
            created by Thomas Wolsey in the court of King Henry VIII.[5] Instructions for growing and harvesting strawberries
            showed up in writing in 1578. By the end of the 16th century three European species had been cited: F. vesca,
            F. moschata, and F. viridis. The garden strawberry was transplanted from the forests and then the plants would
            be propagated asexually by cutting off the runners. Two subspecies of F. vesca were identified: F. sylvestris
            alba and F. sylvestris semperflorens. The introduction of F. virginiana from Eastern North America to Europe
            in the 17th century is an important part of history because this species gave rise to the modern strawberry.
            The new species gradually spread through the continent and did not become completely appreciated until the end
            of the 18th century. When a French excursion journeyed to Chile in 1712, it introduced the strawberry plant with
            female flowers that resulted in the common strawberry that we have today. The Mapuche and Huilliche Indians of
            Chile cultivated the female strawberry species until 1551, when the Spanish came to conquer the land. In 1765,
            a European explorer recorded the cultivation of F. chiloensis, the Chilean strawberry. At first introduction
            to Europe, the plants grew vigorously but produced no fruit. It was discovered in 1766 that the female plants
            could only be pollinated by plants that produced large fruit: F. moschata, F. virginiana, and F. ananassa. This
            is when the Europeans became aware that plants had the ability to produce male-only or female-only flowers. As
            more large-fruit producing plants were cultivated the Chilean strawberry slowly decreased in population in Europe,
            except for around Brest where the Chilean strawberry thrived. The decline of the Chilean strawberry was caused
            by F. ananassa</p>
